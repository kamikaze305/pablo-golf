I'll help you run Pablo and keep it ready. Let me first examine the project structure to understand how to start the application.


Perfect! I can see that Pablo is a golf card game with a client-server architecture. The main development script is `npm run dev` which runs both the server and client concurrently. Let me start the application for you.


Great! I've started Pablo in the background. The application is now running with both the server and client components. Let me check the status to make sure everything is working properly.


I see the issue - PowerShell doesn't support `&&` syntax. Let me fix this and run the command properly for Windows PowerShell.


Perfect! Pablo is now running in the background. Let me check if the processes are running and get some status information.


Excellent! I can see multiple Node.js processes running, which indicates that Pablo is successfully running. Let me also check the network ports to see what services are available.


Let me check the client and server package.json files to see what ports they're configured to use.


Now let me check the Vite configuration to see what port the client is using, and the server configuration for its port.


Let me check what's in the server source directory.


It seems the server source files might be missing. Let me check if there's a different structure or if the files are in a different location.


Great! I found the server configuration. Let me check the compiled server file to see what port it's using.


Perfect! Now I can see the configuration. The server runs on port 4000 and expects the client to be on port 5173 (Vite's default). Let me check if both services are running and accessible.

this is the initial prompt that i gave. use it as context- Goal: Ship a production-ready, locally hosted web implementation of Pablo (4-card Golf variant) with online multiplayer, offline pass-&-play, persistent scoring, and a host-only QA Super User. All setup, secrets, and admin flows live only on the host laptop.

Core Gameplay (Default Rules)

Deck: 52 + 2 Jokers. Values: A=1; 2–10=face; J/Q/K=10; Joker=−5.

Layout: each player has 2×2 facedown; at deal, peek bottom two.

Turn: draw stock or discard. If you keep a card → replace one facedown without looking; replaced card goes face-up to discard.

Power cards (only if drawn from stock and immediately discarded):

7 = Swap one of your cards with any opponent’s. See the incoming card only.

8 = Spy peek any single card (yours or opponent’s).

Call “Pablo” at end of your turn → everyone else gets one last turn → reveal + score.

Scoring: sum values. If caller is lowest, −10 bonus; if not lowest, caller adds a penalty equal to the highest score that round.

Game ends when someone ≥100; lowest total wins.

Room Creation (Host = Game Setter)

Implement a Room Create modal with toggles (all persisted in room settings):

Deck & Values

Jokers: On/Off (default On; Jokers = −5).

Face card values: J/Q/K = 10 (default), or alt values (input).

Powers

7 = Swap (default On)

8 = Spy (default On)

Optional extras: 9, 10, J, Q power variants (checkboxes; off by default).

Table Rules

Matching rule (replace multiple known matches with one drawn card): On/Off (default On).

Target total to end game: 100 (number input).

Reveal on disconnect: On/Off (default Off).

Access

Room Key (auto-generated) + optional Join Password.

Max players: 2–5 (default 5).

Persistence

Scoreboard carryover: On/Off (default On).

Autosave round state: On/Off.

Modes

Online realtime (Socket.IO rooms). Join by Room Key (+ optional password).

Offline

Pass-&-Play on one device.

Solo vs bots (no network).

PWA with full offline for the offline modes.

Super User (QA) — Host Laptop Only

Add a /qa route and a gated QA toolbar visible only when QA_ENABLED=true and the request originates from localhost.

Auth: QA_USER / QA_PASS read from local .env on the host machine. Never send these to clients; never render QA UI remotely.

Capabilities (server-authorized):

Reveal/Hide any player’s cards (read-only to others).

Force actions (deal, draw, inject card to stock/discard, set seed).

Impersonate turn for test flows.

Snapshot/export room state for bug reports.

Server must re-check: QA actions only accepted from 127.0.0.1 (or a host-configurable allowlist) and an active QA session.

Architecture

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind; Zustand for state; react-router.

Backend: Node + Express + Socket.IO (rooms, reconnection, server-authoritative rules).

Persistence:

Client: IndexedDB (Dexie) for settings, local scoreboard, offline saves.

Server: in-memory rooms (v1); file-based snapshots for QA.

Engine: pure TS state machine + RNG (seeded Fisher-Yates).

Testing: Vitest + RTL; engine unit tests; Socket.IO integration tests for 3–5 players.

Security & Fair-Play

Hidden cards live only server-side; clients get placeholders unless owner.

Private peeks are per-player secrets; never broadcast.

Server validates all moves.

Deterministic shuffleSeed stored per round.

QA is sandboxed to localhost with explicit env flag + auth.

Events (Socket.IO)

Client→Server:

room:create { settings }, room:join { roomKey, password? }, room:leave

game:startRound, turn:draw { source }, turn:playPower { kind, payload }, turn:replace { index }, turn:callPablo

chat:post { text }

QA: qa:reveal { playerId }, qa:injectCard { where, card }, qa:setSeed { seed }, qa:forceTurn { playerId }

Server→Client:

state:patch, round:started, turn:you, turn:result, round:scored { deltas, totals }, error

Host-only Deployment (single laptop)

Scripts:

npm run dev → starts server on localhost:4000, client on localhost:5173.

npm run build && npm run serve → production build + single-machine server.

.env.example (host creates real .env):

# server
PORT=4000
ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
QA_ENABLED=true
QA_USER=adminLocalOnly
QA_PASS=strong-password-here
QA_IP_ALLOWLIST=127.0.0.1,::1
# engine
DEFAULT_JOKERS=on
DEFAULT_MATCHING_RULE=on


PWA: cache client assets for offline; offline modes never touch network.

Capacity & Limits (tailored to your laptop)

Your Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 (i7-14700HX, 20c/28t; RTX 4050) has ample headroom. Socket.IO’s practical ceiling on a single node is often thousands of idle connections, but real limits come from OS file-descriptor caps and router/LAN. For smooth play testing:

Recommended cap: up to 20 rooms × 5 players (≈100 concurrent clients) without breaking a sweat.

Stretch goal (LAN-only): 50 rooms × 5 players (~250 clients) with tuned ulimit -n, Node memory flags, and wired Ethernet.

Absolute upper bounds on a single instance can reach 10k+ connections with tuning, but that’s overkill here and network-bound anyway. Use these caps and expose them as envs:

MAX_ROOMS=50
MAX_PLAYERS_PER_ROOM=5
MAX_CONNECTIONS=300

UX Notes

Room Create sheet (host only) includes all toggles above + copyable Room Key and QR.

Player chrome shows 2×2 grid, actions, and “Call Pablo”.

QA ribbon only on localhost: reveal, seed, inject, snapshot.

Round-end modal with per-player deltas + running totals; scoreboard persists.

Deliverables

Monorepo: apps/server, apps/client.

README.md with host-only deployment, QA usage, and rule toggle docs.

Tests: engine, Socket.IO flow, and QA auth.

Lighthouse PWA pass; responsive mobile.

Build order: engine → server (auth & QA) → client → offline modes → polish.

**Cursor**

Thank you for providing the comprehensive context! I can see this is a sophisticated Pablo Golf card game implementation with multiplayer, offline modes, and QA features. Based on the project structure and your requirements, let me get Pablo running and ready for you.

From what I can see, the application is already running in the background. Let me verify the current status and ensure everything is properly configured.


Let me check if the processes are still running and start them if needed.


Great! I can see there are Node.js processes running. Let me check what ports they're using and ensure both the client and server are accessible.


It seems the services might not be fully started yet. Let me restart the development environment to ensure both client and server are running properly.


Now let me start the development environment fresh to ensure both client and server are running properly.


Perfect! Let me wait a moment for the services to start up and then check their status.


Let me check if there are any errors in the development process and see what's happening.
